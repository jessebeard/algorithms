# Intention

As I prep for an Amazon on-site early next week, I want to power through a bunch of these problems in order to make sure that most of the strategies are fresh in my mind.

I'm going to be practicing as if I was in an interview, making sure to write out a strategy, and coding under a hard time limit of 20 mins per problem.
I plan to focus on *medium* difficuty problems, as they are what I'm expected to know.
